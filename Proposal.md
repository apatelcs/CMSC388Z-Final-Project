# Compiler for LANGAUGE in Rust
Team Members: Abhay Patel & Mohammad Ghaemi

## Introduction
---

A compiler is a program that maps some source code from one programming language to another programming language (this is called the target language). Usually, the target language is a lower level programming language. The intent behind this is to use the target language to build a higher level language with more features. We will be borrowing many ideas from CMSC430, an introductory class to implementing compilers at the University of Maryland.<sup>1
